## Implementation Guidelines

### General Plugin Structure

Every H5GG plugin should follow this structure:

```objective-c
// MyPlugin.h
@protocol MyPluginJSExport <JSExport>
// Export methods to JavaScript
-(void)someMethod;
JSExportAs(methodWithParams, -(void)methodWithParam1:(NSString*)p1 param2:(NSString*)p2);
@end

@interface MyPlugin : NSObject <MyPluginJSExport>
@end

// MyPlugin.mm
@implementation MyPlugin
-(instancetype)init {
    // Initialize plugin
    return self;
}

-(void)someMethod {
    // Implementation
}
@end
```

### JavaScript Usage Pattern

```javascript
h5gg.require(7.8); // Minimum H5GG version

// Load plugin
var myPlugin = h5gg.loadPlugin("MyPlugin", "MyPlugin.dylib");

if (!myPlugin) {
    throw "Failed to load plugin!";
}

// Use plugin
myPlugin.someMethod();
```

### Best Practices

1. **Thread Safety**: Always dispatch UI operations to main queue
2. **Error Handling**: Validate inputs and handle errors gracefully
3. **Memory Management**: Use ARC and avoid retain cycles
4. **Performance**: Minimize overhead, especially for frequently called methods
5. **Documentation**: Provide clear usage examples
6. **Compatibility**: Test on different iOS versions
7. **Security**: Don't expose dangerous operations without warnings

### Building Plugins

Use the provided Makefile structure:

```makefile
TARGET = iphone:clang:latest:11.0
ARCHS = arm64

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = MyPlugin
MyPlugin_FILES = Tweak.mm
MyPlugin_FRAMEWORKS = UIKit Foundation JavaScriptCore

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk
```
